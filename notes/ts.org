* Type-Mappings

** Materialize disjunctive Unions to single spatialized Objects

* Unions

** Naturally associative; just what we want for many operations

** Unfortunately unordered; but if we're going object->union->object this doesn't matter

*** putting into object form gives us settled slices: no sliding about, can put in order

* Conditional types map items one-by-one
