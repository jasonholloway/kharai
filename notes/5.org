*stopping*

every summoned machine must contribute to a combined handle; only when all machines that have been summoned have completed will this handle itself complete

summoning shouldn't just return a Promise, then, but this handle

this is basically the IRun interface, that currently only returns a per-machine log
this IRun interface does itself complete, and an aggregation of these would complete also

every interaction returns a new, accumulated IRun, with all machine logs merged into it
