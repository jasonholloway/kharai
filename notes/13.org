What about a kind of fork mechanism?
one machine can create many copies of itself

but creation of others within an action
obviously creates a causative link
and therefore serialisation of saves

but what if the created other is created
but the parent then errors?

this is why the usual meeting mechanism is used

and wouldn't it be the same with forks?

but a fork implies no communication; the other is just chucked into its new situation
