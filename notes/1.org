the same machine can do diffing of csvs

but there is conceptual separation between the two tasks, the two stages

by putting them to execute in turn we lose comparmentalisation: ie errors can kill one stage while leaving the other to carry on happily

though there is an essential coupling between the two stages: diffing shouldonly occur when there is something to newly diff

but failures in diffing shouldn't stop the scraping

so - there are two machines with two states, and the two should be coupled by some kind of stated condition
the /due condition/ isn't just of time, but of state

---

the differ should state that it is only due when the downloader gets ahead of its own cursor
this condition will then span two states, and potentially two rows in the table
as each row has its own version, key and data.

phase needn't be special, though why not

---

the condition could most simply be expressed as an evaluable predicate in javascript
though we want the expression to be actionable close to the data - like a ConditionExpression (though one that spans multiple items)
which can't be
if the state to be compared spans rows then we have to read the entire thing

though our throughput is always going to be small here: data is going to be slim, and how often will our conditions be checked? actually, fairly regularly, after every phase

in evaluating, we want to lazily load states, to minimize what we summon from the cloud
instead of a proper evaluated language, we can 'shallowly embed' using the evaluative glue of the language itself

---

the condition doesn't have to be expressed in data, in fact it's certainly better that it is not

it's part of the runnable spec!

when states change, then each condition gets run to see if it should kick in

and finally, all states should be transactionally written as one

---

what if multiple agents were running at once? then they wouldn't overwrite each other, but they might gazump each other - the spec should be such to allow 
things to coexist as much as possible

what i'm imagining is a workflow of limited size

though if another workflow wanted to read the state of another, it surely could do; streams could be created, not mediated by a crappy condition engine, but by wasteful polling

the benefits of separation, at the cost of efficient timely execution

---

so, we need
- multiple states
	machines should be executed in some arbitrary sequence, so they're concurrent until one waits on another
- a better parsing of 'due'
	two modes, strategies of waiting: no, two /layers/ of waiting
	firstly each machine is only loaded and run if its /due/ value is ready - this saves us loading machines needlessly
	secondly, conditions should be checked if in place
	  and how do we know if a condition is in place? because we know the phase of the machine; and from the phase, we can figure the waiting behaviour
		but conditions can't be per-phase, as phases are multiples - almost nascent machines ready to unfold into full workflows
		while elegant this destroys the simplicity of single-threaded execution and state
		
		conditions are per-machine, but the form of the condition is determined by the /current state/ of the machine, so is singular
		if a machine is due in time, then we load its phase, and...

    maybe the condition check could itself be performed 'manually' within the code of a phase
		the machine will be run, and its waiting phase will just be a loading of another machine's state,
		a checking of it, and a changing of its own phase based on this
		I like this a lot, a big avoidance of building, a commendation of the generality of the underlying model

	--------

so, we need...
- multiple machines
- states loadable via the context
- all states transactionally committed when at rest 
	

the orchestrator of machines is itself a machine, of course
so even the dispatch of machines can be suspended from the original issue

the original machine must be able to load a list of machine names to dispatch
which is its own state

------

but now the thought comes that more state could be given to the original orchestrator itself
machine's phases and due times, for instance, could belong to the orchestrator
then the full state of a machine could be lazily loaded after that point

but now, by vertically separating the state into two classes, into a more private head and more public body, with the possibility of freeing restrictions on the body data
the protection of the body goes too - what if the body is put but not the state? then we'll get inconsistencies

bodies are owned, and writable only by the owning machine

what's to stop another orchestrator, also with the machine listed, from dispatching against its body?
at the same time it is ok for there to be multiple orchestrators, as long as they don't garble the subject machine by their contentious orchestrations

ie phase and version belong to the machine
then the machine can stand as itself

-----

so if the orchestrator is but one machine amongst others
it has its own phase and version (as if these were all owned by /it/, who would own its own phase and version?)

so...
the main requirement is for multiple machine states to be loadable and savable
loading should be via a lazy, cached provider
and then saving of machine states should be done as one big transaction at the end

---

but the orchestrator machine state is itself to be saved
so the loading and saving of states is above the level of the orchestrator
its at the level of the /RUN/

each /RUN/ establishes its provisions (its UoW effectively), loads up its known orchestrator machine
and executes it

but - something is orchestrating the /RUNs/! and this orchestrator has inalienable rights of determining dispatches below
(or, rather, its always possible for it to make sense to have that power)
that is, the above orchestrator should be able to pipe in from above what machines are to be run

in which case, what do we gain by treating the orchestrator as a machine as well?

---

it seems the simpler way of doing itis just having a hard-coded list of machines to execute
these can, for more flexibility, be provided as part of the initial invocation of the run

/there always has to be something invoking the run/

so we will /ALWAYS/ need this mechanism

the question is how much is proper to this layer
child runnables are not needed now, termination isn't needed now
but if it were then we'd need a machine storing the states of things, of owned things
though machineyness is only needed when state has to be protected
whatever... we will always need invocation of a list of machines

---

*we need a RUN*
