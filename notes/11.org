* WatchMap
  we want to view the progress of other machines, without affecting them, a kind of snooping operation
  but `watchRaw` is a bit intrusive like
  so each phase can specify its state mapping
  a synchronous op from state to view - or is it?
  why can't it be async? well, it can return callable callbacks
  the idea is that it can't capture anything private to the source
  in particular the meeting functions are precious

  if a phase registers its projection, it's just reserving its own place
  in the licking into shape of its inner state
  which seems reasonable
  my only fear is of the complicating of the api
  we need to register projections as well as handlers
  though by default nothing needs to be registered

  it is necessary though
  consumers could watch and try to extract
  this would make them blind potentially to intermediate states
  so, like a porpoise, a program could briefly appear in a form
  before doing other things and reappearing in the same form later
  only now slightly transmuted
