* FlowSpace
  aka RunSpace

  should take on as many responsibilities as is fitting from the MachineSpace

  commit-tracking is one thing
  each action is performed with a commit
  this then allows RunCtx to do attends/convenes more completely

  RunSpace has though no registry of runnables
  it has its Runs, which are distinct objects
  and one Run can talk to another Run, one at a time

  so what I need to do is slowly migrate functionality into the RunSpace

  and the commit comes with the Run
  if you summon a Run, you have your ongoing place in history

  which means as well that the Run must have its commit$, internally at least
