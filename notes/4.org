PROBLEM REVEALED:

things aren't entirely synchronous at all...
there's a promise wait in the middle of the conversation... 

to make it all tight and deterministic we therefore need to complicate the calling protocol
instead of just 'wait for promise', we need to make the caller play a part in the locking...

or rather, no we don't

in fact this doesn't make sense again on second thought
